1. It's good to use margin-top or bottom for handling Margin collapsing(when 2 adjacent elements
share one margin even though each element has it's own one, the bigger element wins). -https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing

2. Please use comments

3. Use shorthand to simplify things where necessary.
